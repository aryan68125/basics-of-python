# basics-of-python
this includes number of basic python programs for bigenners
Note:- if you have written python3 code then you will have to compile it using python 3
just type python3 Your_program_name.py this will compile your code using python 3 when typed in the terminal
it works both on linux and macOS and I couldn't care less about windows users so .... yea
just so you know if you compile the code using python Your_program_name.py then it will compile the program file using python2
as python2 is the default in both linux and manOS so keep it in mind and dont even try to change the default python version on your mechine
otherwise your operating system will break or if you are lucky it will break partially means some of its functionalities won't simply
work so yea...PLEASE dont do that
